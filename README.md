MajoranaNanowires is a numerical package for Python which allows to model and simulate Majorana nanowires devices. Simulations could describe either finite or infinite, and 1D or quasi-1D nanowires, using tight-binding Hamiltonians to this end. Simulations could also include the interaction with the electrostatic environment which surrounds the nanowire, which is solved using finite element methods.
