MajoranaNanowires is a numerical package for Python that allows to model and simulate Majorana nanowire devices an other related semiconductor/superconductor heterostructures. The simulations can include both, the description of the nanowire (or other structures) using tight-binding Hamiltonians, and the electrostatic interactions with the environment using finite element methods (Fenics).
